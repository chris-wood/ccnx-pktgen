1. replace data generation functions in constructor and parser with the generator ones
2. re-add the content object generator function(s)
3. add a generator function to sample from a file

rename: parser.hs to ???
remove: constructor.hs (obselete)
rename data generation functions to something better (name as the "generator" is confusing and prevents me from using 'name' as a variable)
